# organn

An attempt at something resembling a drawbar organ. Largely an experiment in audio coding.

Currently only supports CoreAudio on OSX. Apologies to linux/windows people.

Big thanks to [RustAudio](https://github.com/RustAudio) for the library bindings; the sound output side of this has been easy so far.
