# organn

An attempt at something resembling a drawbar organ. Largely an experiment in audio coding.

At the moment it cannot use midi input so it plays a sequence that sounds like [this](https://m.soundcloud.com/whatmilk/organn-v020).

Only supports CoreAudio on OSX. Apologies to linux/windows people. I eventually plan to get some other audio support working.

Big thanks to [RustAudio](https://github.com/RustAudio) for the library bindings; the sound output side of this has been easy so far.
